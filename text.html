    <p><b>HTML</b> -- HTML stands for <b>Hyper text markup language</b> which is basically used to create the 
        structure of web pages on browser and it consists of series of elements and also 
        used to provide label. HTML is a standard language but it is not a programming language , 
        It tells the browser how to display the content. 
    </p>
    <h4>Now we sholud know what is Web page ...?</br>
        Web page is a web document that is suitable for world wide web and web browsers.
        
    <p>For learning HTML , I am using visual studio code and i have install two extensions 
        First extension is prettier -- Prettier is a tool that makes our code more 
        consistent and readable. It does this by automatically adding a style guide to our project , 
        And other one is live server -- The extension manually refreshing the browser each time 
        if we make any changes, which can add up in larger projects. 
        It is particularly handy or used for web developers working with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
    </p>

        <b> Coming to visual studio code , there is one short cut for writing html code " shift + ! + Enter" 
            and it will write the code !.</b>
    </h4>

    <p>What is the use of <b>Doctype </b>-- Doctype is not a Tag , 
        it's an instruction to the web browser about what version of HTML the page is written in. 
        It stands for "Document Type Declaration". Its primary purpose is to tell the web browser 
        which version of HTML the page is using, so that the browser can render the page correctly. 
        
        <b>HTML Tag </b>-- Here html tag is the root element and we are writing everything inside it . 
        
    <h4> Now the Question is that what is the element -- Basically , Each element represented by a 
        pairs of tags opening tag , closing tag and storing some content inside it called element. 
        For Example -- paragraph tag , html tag , head tag , body tag , etc. 
    </h4>
</br>
        
        Coming to head tag -- It is used to store the meta information , title , link , seo etc. 
        Meta Tag -- Metadata is data about the HTML document itself, such as the character encoding, 
        author, description, keywords, and viewport settings.
